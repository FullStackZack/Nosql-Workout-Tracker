# No-SQL Workout Tracker

Link to deployed app: https://immense-lowlands-48693.herokuapp.com/?id=5fa474d03be6d30017815c59

## Description
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
